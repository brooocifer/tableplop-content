Templates and associated utilities for representing BECMI creatures and monsters as characters in Tableplop

# Index
- Monster AC 9.json - The original manually built creature template for a generic monster. I add the monster's AC into the filename and creature name in Tableplop to allow for players to easily see the AC and to aid in combat message prompts.
- README.md - this file
- curve-fitting.md - Explanation of how curve fitting is used to represent Old School tables via functions/formulas for creatures
- exporttojson.bas - Libreoffice BASIC macro for exporting a spreadsheet of creatures into individual json files for import into Tableplop as characters. The input is from a modified version of the "A-Z Monster List" tab from Graham Duckworth's Random Encounter Generator spreadsheet, hosted at Dragonsfoot at: https://www.dragonsfoot.org/php4/archive.php?sectioninit=CD&fileid=270.
